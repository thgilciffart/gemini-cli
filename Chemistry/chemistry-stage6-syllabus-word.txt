Introduction
Stage 6 Curriculum
NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) Stage 6 syllabuses have been developed to provide students with opportunities to further develop skills which will assist in the next stage of their lives.

The purpose of Stage 6 syllabuses is to:
develop a solid foundation of literacy and numeracy
provide a curriculum structure which encourages students to complete secondary education at their highest possible level
foster the intellectual, creative, ethical and social development of students, in particular relating to:
application of knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes in the fields of study they choose
capacity to manage their own learning and to become flexible, independent thinkers, problem-solvers and decision-makers
capacity to work collaboratively with others
respect for the cultural diversity of Australian society
desire to continue learning in formal or informal settings after school
provide a flexible structure within which students can meet the challenges of and prepare for:
further academic study, vocational training and employment
changing workplaces, including an increasingly STEM-focused (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) workforce
full and active participation as global citizens
provide formal assessment and certification of students’ achievements
promote the development of students’ values, identity and self-respect.

The Stage 6 syllabuses reflect the principles of the NESA K–10 Curriculum Framework and Statement of Equity Principles, the reforms of the NSW Government Stronger HSC Standards (2016), and nationally agreed educational goals. These syllabuses build on the continuum of learning developed in the K–10 syllabuses.

The syllabuses provide a set of broad learning outcomes that summarise the knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes important for students to succeed in and beyond their schooling. In particular, the attainment of skills in literacy and numeracy needed for further study, employment and active participation in society are provided in the syllabuses in alignment with the Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF).

The Stage 6 syllabuses include the content of the Australian curriculum and additional descriptions that clarify the scope and depth of learning in each subject.

NESA syllabuses support a standards-referenced approach to assessment by detailing the important knowledge, understanding, skills, values and attitudes students will develop and outlining clear standards of what students are expected to know and be able to do. The syllabuses take into account the diverse needs of all students and provide structures and processes by which teachers can provide continuity of study for all students.

Diversity of Learners
NSW Stage 6 syllabuses are inclusive of the learning needs of all students. Syllabuses accommodate teaching approaches that support student diversity, including students with special education needs, gifted and talented students, and students learning English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D). Students may have more than one learning need.
Students with Special Education Needs
All students are entitled to participate in and progress through the curriculum. Schools are required to provide additional support or adjustments to teaching, learning and assessment activities for some students with special education needs. Adjustments are measures or actions taken in relation to teaching, learning and assessment that enable a student with special education needs to access syllabus outcomes and content, and demonstrate achievement of outcomes.

Students with special education needs can access the outcomes and content from Stage 6 syllabuses in a range of ways. Students may engage with:
Stage 6 syllabus outcomes and content with adjustments to teaching, learning and/or assessment activities; or
selected Stage 6 Life Skills outcomes and content from one or more Stage 6 Life Skills syllabuses.

Decisions regarding curriculum options, including adjustments, should be made in the context of collaborative curriculum planning with the student, parent/carer and other significant individuals to ensure that decisions are appropriate for the learning needs and priorities of individual students.

The Science Life Skills Stage 6 Syllabus has been developed from the rationale, aim and objectives of the Investigating Science Stage 6 Syllabus.

Further information can be found in support materials for:
Chemistry
Special education needs
Life Skills.
Gifted and Talented Students
Gifted students have specific learning needs that may require adjustments to the pace, level and content of the curriculum. Differentiated educational opportunities assist in meeting the needs of gifted students.

Generally, gifted students demonstrate the following characteristics:
the capacity to learn at faster rates
the capacity to find and solve problems
the capacity to make connections and manipulate abstract ideas.

There are different kinds and levels of giftedness. Gifted and talented students may also possess learning difficulties and/or disabilities that should be addressed when planning appropriate teaching, learning and assessment activities.

Curriculum strategies for gifted and talented students may include:
differentiation: modifying the pace, level and content of teaching, learning and assessment activities
acceleration: promoting a student to a level of study beyond their age group
curriculum compacting: assessing a student’s current level of learning and addressing aspects of the curriculum that have not yet been mastered.

School decisions about appropriate strategies are generally collaborative and involve teachers, parents and students with reference to documents and advice available from NESA and the education sectors.

Gifted and talented students may also benefit from individual planning to determine the curriculum options, as well as teaching, learning and assessment strategies, most suited to their needs and abilities.
Students Learning English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D)
Many students in Australian schools are learning English as an additional language or dialect (EAL/D). EAL/D students are those whose first language is a language or dialect other than Standard Australian English and who require additional support to assist them to develop English language proficiency.

EAL/D students come from diverse backgrounds and may include:
overseas and Australian-born students whose first language is a language other than English, including creoles and related varieties
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students whose first language is Aboriginal English, including Kriol and related varieties.

EAL/D students enter Australian schools at different ages and stages of schooling and at different stages of English language learning. They have diverse talents and capabilities and a range of prior learning experiences and levels of literacy in their first language and in English. EAL/D students represent a significant and growing percentage of learners in NSW schools. For some, school is the only place they use Standard Australian English.

EAL/D students are simultaneously learning a new language and the knowledge, understanding and skills of the Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus through that new language. They may require additional support, along with informed teaching that explicitly addresses their language needs.

The ESL Scales and the English as an Additional Language or Dialect: Teacher Resource provide information about the English language development phases of EAL/D students. These materials and other resources can be used to support the specific needs of English language learners and to assist students to access syllabus outcomes and content.
Chemistry Key
The following codes and icons are used in the Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus.
Outcome Coding
Syllabus outcomes have been coded in a consistent way. The code identifies the subject, Year and outcome number. For example:
 

Outcome code	Interpretation
CH11/12-1	Chemistry – outcome number 1
CH11-8	Year 11 Chemistry – outcome number 8
CH12-12	Year 12 Chemistry – outcome number 12

Working Scientifically outcomes 1–7 are common across Year 11 and Year 12.

Knowledge and Understanding outcomes in Year 11 are numbered 8–11.

Knowledge and Understanding outcomes in Year 12 are numbered 12–15.
Coding of Australian Curriculum Content
Australian curriculum content descriptions included in the syllabus are identified by an Australian curriculum code which appears in brackets at the end of each content description. For example:
Conduct investigations, including the use of devices to accurately measure temperature change and mass, safely, competently and methodically for the collection of valid and reliable data (ACSCH003).

 

Where a number of content descriptions are jointly represented, all description codes are included, for example (ACSCH001, ACSCH002, ACSCH003).

Learning Across the Curriculum Icons
Learning across the curriculum content, including cross-curriculum priorities, general capabilities and other areas identified as important learning for all students, is incorporated and identified by icons in the syllabus.

Cross-curriculum priorities
  	Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures
  	Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia
  	Sustainability

General capabilities
  	Critical and creative thinking
  	Ethical understanding
  	Information and communication technology capability
  	Intercultural understanding
  	Literacy
  	Numeracy
  	Personal and social capability

Other learning across the curriculum areas
  	Civics and citizenship
  	Difference and diversity
  	Work and enterprise

Rationale
The Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus explores the structure, composition and reactions of and between all elements, compounds and mixtures that exist in the Universe. The discovery and synthesis of new compounds, the monitoring of elements and compounds in the environment, and an understanding of industrial processes and their applications to life processes are central to human progress and our ability to develop future industries and sustainability.

The course further develops an understanding of chemistry through the application of Working Scientifically skills. It focuses on the exploration of models, understanding of theories and laws, and examination of the interconnectedness between seemingly dissimilar phenomena.

Chemistry involves using differing scales, specialised representations, explanations, predictions and creativity, especially in the development and pursuit of new materials. It requires students to use their imagination to visualise the dynamic, minuscule world of atoms in order to gain a better understanding of how chemicals interact.
The Chemistry course builds on students’ knowledge and skills developed in the Science Stage 5 course and increases their understanding of chemistry as a foundation for undertaking investigations in a wide range of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related fields. A knowledge and understanding of chemistry is often the unifying link between interdisciplinary studies.
The course provides the foundation knowledge and skills required to study chemistry after completing school, and supports participation in a range of careers in chemistry and related interdisciplinary industries. It is an essential discipline that currently addresses and will continue to address our energy needs and uses, the development of new materials, and sustainability issues as they arise.

Assessment and Reporting
Information about assessment in relation to the Chemistry syllabus is contained in Assessment and Reporting in Chemistry Stage 6. It outlines course-specific advice and requirements regarding:
Year 11 and Year 12 school-based assessment requirements
Year 11 and Year 12 mandatory components and weightings
External assessment requirements including HSC examination specifications.

This information should be read in conjunction with requirements on the Assessment Certification Examination (ACE) website.

Additional advice is available in the Principles of Assessment for Stage 6.

Content
Content defines what students are expected to know and do as they work towards syllabus outcomes. It provides the foundations for students to successfully progress to the next stage of schooling or post-school opportunities.
Teachers will make decisions about content regarding the sequence, emphasis and any adjustments required based on the needs, interests, abilities and prior learning of students.
Content in Stage 6 syllabuses defines learning expectations that may be assessed in Higher School Certificate examinations.
Organisation of Content
The following diagram provides an illustrative representation of elements of the course and their relationship.

The Year 11 and Year 12 courses each comprise four modules. The skills of Working Scientifically are integrated as course content throughout the syllabus. Each module includes a specific focus on some of the Working Scientifically skills. However, there is scope within each module to engage with all of the Working Scientifically skills.

 

The Working Scientifically outcomes and content are integrated into each module wherever students undertake an investigation.

Working Scientifically
Working Scientifically skills are at the core of conducting practical and secondary-sourced investigations in science.

Opportunities should be provided for students to engage with all the Working Scientifically skills in investigations. In each module, particular outcomes have been identified as those that are most relevant to the intended learning.

Students are challenged to further develop their understanding of Working Scientifically as a group of dynamic and interdependent processes that are applied in each scientific investigation in a way that is appropriate and determined by the activity. This dynamism and interrelatedness adds a level of sophistication to students’ understanding of the true nature and practice of science. Through regular involvement in these processes, applying them as appropriate, in a range of varied practical investigations, students can broaden their interpretation of Working Scientifically beyond the common linear model.

Students are encouraged to select the most appropriate gateway to the Working Scientifically processes. The pathways within the processes become self-evident through the nature of the investigation. An investigation may be instigated by, for example:
direct observation of a phenomenon
inconsistencies arising from results of a related investigation
the qualitative and quantitative analysis of data
secondary-sourced research.

Students are challenged to be open to:
refining or redeveloping their chosen procedures
redefining their questions and/or hypotheses
modifying their methodologies or designs
conducting further practical investigations
conducting further secondary research.

Students are also encouraged to communicate evidence-based conclusions and suggest ideas for future research. Unexpected results are to be welcomed to refine methodologies and to generate further investigation. Knowledge and understanding of science is essential to these processes. Through this practice of science, students can acquire a deeper knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts.

 
Each of the seven Working Scientifically outcomes represents one of the interdependent dynamic processes that are central to the study of science and the acquisition of scientific knowledge and skills. This course is structured to provide ongoing opportunities for students to implement these processes, particularly through the depth study provision. The following descriptions of the Working Scientifically outcomes provide further information about the skills students are expected to develop throughout the course.
Questioning and Predicting
Developing, proposing and evaluating inquiry questions and hypotheses challenges students to identify an issue or phenomenon that can be investigated scientifically by gathering primary and/or secondary-sourced data. Students develop inquiry question(s) that require observations, experimentation and/or research to aid in constructing a reasonable and informed hypothesis. The consideration of variables is to be included in the questioning process.

Planning Investigations
Students justify the selection of equipment, resources chosen and design of an investigation. They ensure that all risks are assessed, appropriate materials and technologies are sourced, and all ethical concerns are considered. Variables are to be identified as independent, dependent and controlled to ensure a valid procedure is developed that will allow for the reliable collection of data. Investigations should include strategies that ensure controlled variables are kept constant and an experimental control is used as appropriate.
Conducting Investigations
Students are to select appropriate equipment, employ safe work practices and ensure that risk assessments are conducted and followed. Appropriate technologies are to be used and procedures followed when disposing of waste. The selection and criteria for collecting valid and reliable data is to be methodical and, where appropriate, secondary-sourced information referenced correctly.
Processing Data and Information
Students use the most appropriate and meaningful methods and media to organise and analyse data and information sources, including digital technologies and the use of a variety of visual representations as appropriate. They process data from primary and secondary sources, including both qualitative and quantitative data and information.
Analysing Data and Information
Students identify trends, patterns and relationships; recognise error, uncertainty and limitations in data; and interpret scientific and media texts. They evaluate the relevance, accuracy, validity and reliability of the primary or secondary-sourced data in relation to investigations. They evaluate processes, claims and conclusions by considering the quality of available evidence, and use reasoning to construct scientific arguments. Where appropriate, mathematical models are to be applied to demonstrate the trends and relationships that occur in data.
Problem Solving
Students use critical thinking skills and creativity to demonstrate an understanding of scientific principles underlying the solutions to inquiry questions and problems posed in investigations. Appropriate and varied strategies are employed, including the use of models, to qualitatively and quantitatively and explain and predict cause-and-effect relationships. In Working Scientifically, students synthesise and use evidence to construct and justify conclusions. To solve problems, students: interpret scientific and media texts; evaluate processes, claims and conclusions; and consider the quality of available evidence.
Communicating
Communicating all components of the Working Scientifically processes with clarity and accuracy is essential. Students use qualitative and quantitative information gained from investigations using primary and secondary sources, including digital, visual, written and/or verbal forms of communication as appropriate. Students apply appropriate scientific notations and nomenclature. They also appropriately apply and use scientific language that is suitable for specific audiences and contexts.
Investigations
An investigation is a scientific process to answer a question, explore an idea or solve a problem. Investigations include activities such as planning a course of action, collecting data, processing and analysing data, reaching a conclusion and communicating. Investigations may include the collection of primary and/or secondary-sourced data or information.

Practical investigations involve the collection of primary data. They may include:
undertaking laboratory investigations, including fair tests and controlled experiments
undertaking fieldwork and surveys
constructing models.

Secondary-sourced investigations can include:
researching by using a variety of media
extracting and reorganising secondary-sourced information in the form of flow charts, tables, graphs, diagrams, prose, keys, spreadsheets and databases
using models to inform understanding.
Safety
Schools have a legal obligation in relation to safety. Teachers will need to ensure that they comply with relevant legislation as well as system and school requirements in relation to safety when implementing their programs. This includes legislation and guidelines relating to Work Health and Safety, and the handling and storage of chemical and dangerous goods.
Animal Research
Schools have a legal responsibility in relation to the welfare of animals. The keeping of animals and all practical activities involving animals must comply with relevant guidelines or legislation.
Inquiry Questions
Inquiry questions are included in the course content and used to frame the syllabus content within each module. The depth of knowledge and understanding and skill development required to fully address the inquiry questions may vary. This allows for differentiation of the course content to cater for the diversity of learners.

Depth Studies: Year 11 and Year 12
What are Depth Studies?
A depth study is any type of investigation/activity that a student completes individually or collaboratively that allows the further development of one or more concepts found within or inspired by the syllabus. It may be one investigation/activity or a series of investigations/activities.

Depth studies provide opportunities for students to pursue their interests in chemistry, acquire a depth of understanding, and take responsibility for their own learning. Depth studies promote differentiation and engagement, and support all forms of assessment, including assessment for, as and of learning. Depth studies allow for the demonstration of a range of Working Scientifically skills.

A depth study may be, but is not limited to:
a practical investigation or series of practical investigations and/or a secondary-sourced investigation or series of secondary-sourced investigations
presentations, research assignments or fieldwork reports
the extension of concepts found within the course, either qualitatively and/or quantitatively.

The length of time for any individual study and the pedagogies employed are not prescribed. The time for the depth studies may be allocated to a single study or spread over the year, and incorporate several studies depending on individual school and/or class requirements.
Requirements for Depth Studies
A minimum of 15 hours of in-class time is allocated in both Year 11 and Year 12.
At least one depth study must be included in both Year 11 and Year 12.
The two Working Scientifically outcomes of Questioning and Predicting, and Communicating must be addressed in both Year 11 and Year 12.
A minimum of two additional Working Scientifically skills outcomes, and further development of at least one Knowledge and Understanding outcome, are to be addressed in all depth studies.

research analysis, eg of longitudinal data, resource management data.

 
Learning Across the Curriculum
Learning across the curriculum content, including the cross-curriculum priorities and general capabilities, assists students to achieve the broad learning outcomes defined in the NESA Statement of Equity Principles, the Melbourne Declaration on Educational Goals for Young Australians (December 2008) and in the Australian Government’s Core Skills for Work Developmental Framework (2013).

Cross-curriculum priorities enable students to develop understanding about and address the contemporary issues they face.

The cross-curriculum priorities are:
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures  
Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia  
Sustainability  

General capabilities encompass the knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours required to assist students to live and work successfully in the 21st century.

The general capabilities are:
Critical and creative thinking  
Ethical understanding  
Information and communication technology capability  
Intercultural understanding  
Literacy  
Numeracy  
Personal and social capability.  

NESA syllabuses include other areas identified as important learning for all students, including:
Civics and citizenship  
Difference and diversity  
Work and enterprise  

Learning across the curriculum content is incorporated, and identified by icons, in the content of the Chemistry Stage 6 Syllabus in the following ways.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Histories and Cultures  
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities have diverse cultures, social structures and a history of unique, complex knowledge systems. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to learn about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples have developed and refined knowledge about the world through observation, making predictions, testing (trial and error) and responding to environmental factors within specific contexts. Students investigate examples of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples’ understanding of the environment and the ways in which traditional knowledge and Western scientific knowledge can be complementary.

When planning and programming content relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures teachers are encouraged to:
involve local Aboriginal communities and/or appropriate knowledge holders in determining suitable resources, or to use Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander authored or endorsed publications
read the Principles and Protocols relating to teaching and learning about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures and the involvement of local Aboriginal communities.
Asia and Australia’s Engagement with Asia  
Asia and Australia’s engagement with Asia provides rich and engaging contexts for developing students’ scientific and technological knowledge, understanding and skills. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to recognise that the Asia region includes diverse environments. They are provided with opportunities to appreciate how interactions within and between these environments and the impacts of human activity influence the region, including Australia, and have significance for the rest of the world.

Asia plays an important role in scientific and technological research and development in areas such as medicine, natural resource management and natural disaster prediction and management.
Sustainability  
Sustainability is concerned with the ongoing capacity of the Earth to maintain all life. It provides authentic contexts for exploring, investigating and understanding systems in natural and human-made environments. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to investigate relationships between systems and system components, and consider the sustainability of food sources and the natural and human environments. They engage in ethical debate and with different perspectives in solving ethical problems.
Critical and Creative Thinking  
Critical and creative thinking are integral to activities where students learn to generate and evaluate knowledge, clarify concepts and ideas, seek possibilities, consider alternatives and solve problems. Critical and creative thinking are embedded in the skills and processes of Working Scientifically. In order to make evidence-based decisions, students are provided with opportunities to develop critical and creative thinking skills through: asking and posing questions; making predictions; engaging in practical and secondary-source investigations; and analysing and evaluating evidence.

Ethical Understanding  
Students are provided with opportunities to develop the capability to assess ethical values and principles, and to understand how reasoning can assist ethical judgement. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to form and make ethical judgements in relation to scientific investigations, design, codes of practice, and the use of scientific information and applications. Students explore the importance of reporting honestly based on evidence. They apply ethical guidelines in their investigations, particularly in regard to the implications for others and the environment.
Information and Communication Technology Capability  
Information and communication technology (ICT) can be used effectively and appropriately to access, create and communicate information and ideas, solve problems and work collaboratively. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to develop ICT capability when they: develop ideas, concepts and solutions; research science concepts and applications; investigate scientific phenomena; and communicate their scientific and technological understandings. In particular, they have opportunities to learn to: access information; collect, analyse and represent data; model and interpret concepts and relationships; and communicate scientific and technological ideas, processes and information.
Intercultural Understanding  
Students develop intercultural understanding as they learn to understand themselves in relation to others. This involves students valuing their own cultures and those of others, and engaging with people of diverse cultures in ways that recognise commonalities and differences, create connections and cultivate respect. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to appreciate how diverse cultural perspectives have impacted on the development, breadth and diversity of scientific knowledge and applications. They learn about and engage with issues requiring cultural sensitivity, and learn that scientists work in culturally diverse teams to address issues and solve problems of national and international importance.
Literacy  
Literacy is the ability to use a repertoire of knowledge and skills to communicate and comprehend effectively, using a variety of modes and media. Being ‘literate’ is more than the acquisition of technical skills – it includes the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create and communicate effectively using written, visual and digital forms of expression and communication for a number of purposes. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to understand that language varies according to the context and engage with different forms of written and spoken language to communicate scientific concepts. They learn that scientific information can also be presented in the form of diagrams, flow charts, tables, graphs and models.
Numeracy  
Numeracy involves recognising and understanding the role of mathematics in the world. Students become numerate as they develop the confidence, willingness and ability to apply mathematics in their lives in constructive and meaningful ways. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to develop numeracy skills through practical measurement and the collection, representation and interpretation of data from first-hand investigations and secondary sources. Students consider issues of uncertainty and reliability in measurement and have opportunities to learn data analysis skills, identifying trends and patterns from numerical data and graphs. They apply mathematical equations and concepts in order to solve problems.

Personal and Social Capability  
Students develop personal and social capability as they learn to understand and manage themselves, their relationships and their lives more effectively. This includes establishing positive relationships, making responsible decisions, working effectively individually and in teams, and constructively handling challenging situations. Through applying the processes of Working Scientifically, students can develop skills in collaboration, peer assessment and review. They plan and conduct a depth study, either individually or in a team.
Civics and Citizenship  
Civics and citizenship content involves knowledge and understanding of how our Australian society operates. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities to broaden their understanding of aspects of civics and citizenship related to the application of scientific ideas and technological advances, including ecological sustainability and the development of environmental and sustainable practices at a local, regional and national level.
Difference and Diversity  
Difference and diversity comprise gender, race and socio-economic circumstances. Students are provided with opportunities to understand and appreciate the difference and diversity they experience in their everyday lives. Working Scientifically provides opportunities for students to work collaboratively, where they can develop an appreciation of the values and ideas of all group members. This appreciation also enables students to identify individual rights, challenge stereotypes and engage with opinions that are different to their own.
Work and Enterprise  
Students can develop work-related skills and an appreciation of the value of working individually and collaboratively when conducting investigations. In Chemistry students are provided with opportunities for students to prioritise safe practices and understand the potential risks and hazards present when conducting investigations. They engage with risk assessment while working safely in the laboratory or the field.

Content Focus
Students analyse trends and patterns in relation to the properties of pure substances and use these to predict the properties of other pure substances. This knowledge is used to determine the ways in which substances can be separated from each other and those that allow them to remain together.

Matter can be either pure substances with distinct measurable properties (eg melting and boiling points, reactivity, strength, density) or mixtures with properties that are dependent on the identity and relative amounts of the substances that make up the mixture. The analysis of these properties has led to the expansion of the periodic table of elements and the advancement of atomic theory. This understanding has allowed for the development of complex models that have been subject to extensive peer review, and has contributed to advances in many disciplines over time.

Students use knowledge obtained from the study of the periodic table to examine trends and patterns that exist between chemical elements and atoms in order to discover that fundamental particles, and their role in the structure of an atom, give all chemicals their properties.

hypothesis	A tentative explanation for an observed phenomenon, expressed as a precise and unambiguous statement that can be supported or refuted by investigation.
independent variable	A variable that is changed in an investigation to see what effect it has on the dependent variable.
investigation	A scientific process of answering a question, exploring an idea or solving a problem, which requires activities such as planning a course of action, collecting data, interpreting data, reaching a conclusion and communicating these activities. Investigations can include practical and/or secondary-sourced data or information.
